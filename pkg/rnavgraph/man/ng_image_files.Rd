\title{
  Import color image files (png, jpg, bmp, etc...) into a NG_image object
}
\description{
  NG_image objects are needed to plot images in the tk2d device.

  Supported file types are those supported by the tcl Img extension. If
  your R can not access the Img extension (currently under Windows) you
  can not import such files. However if you know tcl and R well enough,
  you might create your own NG_image object as shown in the images_iris
  demo.
  
  See the "files_aloi" and "images_iris" demos
  (\code{demo(package="RnavGraph")}) for examples.
